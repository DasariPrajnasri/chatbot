# Task 4 — AI Chatbot (Python)

## 🤖 Project Description
A Python command-line chatbot that interacts with users using simple **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques like **NLTK tokenization** and keyword-based response logic. Built to demonstrate intermediate Python skills including **functions, loops, conditionals, and randomized conversational replies**.

---

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- `random` (standard library)
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)

---

## 📦 Installation Command (used in terminal)
```bash
pip install nltk

## ▶️ How to Run Without Errors

## ✅ Recommended (Local System / IDE)

Open terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell / VS Code Terminal / PyCharm Terminal)

Install NLTK:

pip install nltk


## Run the chatbot:

python chatbot.py

## ❌ Not Supported

Most online Python compilers (unless they support package installation like Replit or Kaggle)

## ⚠ Note for Online Compilers

This chatbot uses NLTK, which cannot run in many online Python compilers without installing the package or downloading NLTK data.
To avoid errors, run it on your local machine or supported IDE terminals.

## 🖼 Sample Output (Example Run)
🤖 Vayun AI Bot Activated! (Type 'bye' to exit)

You: hello
Bot: Hey! How can I assist?

You: what is your name?
Bot: I'm Vayun AI Bot, your NLP-powered chatbot!

You: how are you?
Bot: I'm just a Python bot, but I'm working great!

You: tell me a number
Bot: Here’s a random number for you: 137

You: bye
Bot: Goodbye! Keep learning and keep coding!


Output varies slightly every run due to random responses.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding basic NLP using NLTK

Text tokenization and keyword matching

Implementing logic through loops and conditionals

Handling user interaction in Python
